# 2024_Portfolio
Portfolio of files from community college classes. Includes: C#, C++, Visual Basic, and Python.

These are mostly very basic projects mostly for understanding the basic concepts of the programming language.
However, they are no doubt useful to go back for reference in coding notes, formatting, and expermenting for bugs.

These files can be found under different branches.
